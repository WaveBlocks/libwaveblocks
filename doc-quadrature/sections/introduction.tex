\section{Introduction}

This work is part of an effort to port the WaveBlocksND project
\cite{waveblocksnd} from Python to C++, using the Eigen template library for
linear algebra.
WaveBlocksND provides a framework for quantum-physical simulations, in
particular to calculate the time propagation of wavepackets in different
potentials.
The necessary theory for the calculations and algorithms is given in
\cite{B_master_thesis}.

In this work, we focus on implementing quadrature and inner product calculations
for the wavepackets, which is a prerequisite for the time-propagation
algorithms.

This report will show formulas and rules used for numerical quadrature,
the code structure for building inner products, as well as describing the
additional complexity arising from multi-component wavepackets.

Because one of the reasons of porting the code to C++ was to speed up the
programs, run-time measurements will also show the achieved improvements.

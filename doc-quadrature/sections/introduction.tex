\section{Introduction}

This work is part of an effort to port the WaveBlocksND project
\cite{waveblocksnd} from Python to C++.
WaveBlocksND provides a framework for quantum-physical simulations, in
particular to calculate the time propagation of wavepackets in different
potentials.
The necessary theory for the calculations and algorithms is given in
\cite{B_master_thesis}.

In this work, we focus on implementing quadrature and inner product calculations
for the wavepackets, which is a prerequisite for the time-propagation
algorithms.

\section{Quadrature}

The central building block for evaluating inner products is the calculation of
integrals between wavepackets.
This is done numerically with a quadrature rule, of which there are many
different kinds.


\subsection{Gauss-Hermite Quadrature}
\label{subsec:ghquad}

The basic integration algorithm used in this project is the one-dimensional
Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
Like related rules, this method works by evaluating the integrand function at a
defined set of nodes $\gamma_i$, the values of which are summed up with specific
weights $\omega_i$:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gaussquad}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) \, dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(\gamma_i) \omega_i
\end{equation}

In its basic form, the Gauss-Hermite rule works on special integrals of the
following form:

\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} f(x) \, dx
\end{equation}

However, as we require the quadrature to work on general functions,
transformations are done to the usual weights and nodes which is described in
\cite{B_master_thesis}.
The result is a rule in the form of \eqref{eq:gaussquad}.
Figure~\ref{fig:ghexample} shows an example of the node distribution of a
Gauss-Hermite rule.

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \input{figures/gh-rule.tex}
  \caption{45-point Gauss-Hermite nodes and weights.}
  \label{fig:ghexample}
\end{figure}

For the implementation of this rule, an auxiliary Python script was made to
automatically generate C++-code with hardcoded tables of nodes and weights for
different orders.

The source code can be found under \path{scripts/create_tables.py} and
\path{waveblocks/gauss_hermite_qr.hpp}.


\subsection{Tensor-Product Quadrature}
\label{subsec:tpquad}

The wavepackets that are processed by WaveBlocks are generally multi-dimensional.
To handle this, tensor-products of $D$ one-dimensional quadrature rules can be
built up.

Denoting the $i$-th node-weight-pair of the $d$-th scalar quadrature rule
$(\gamma_i^d,\ \omega_i^d)$, the resulting pair at the multi-index $\vect{j} =
(j_1, \ldots, j_d)$ for the resulting tensor quadrature rule is:

\begin{equation}
  (\gamma_{\vect{j}},\ \omega_{\vect{j}}) = \left(
    \begin{pmatrix} \gamma_{j_1}^1 \\ \vdots \\ \gamma_{j_d}^d \end{pmatrix},
    \ \prod_{d=1}^D \omega_{j_d}^d
  \right)
\end{equation}

A two-dimensional quadrature rule is shown in figure~\ref{fig:tpexample}.

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \input{figures/tp-rule.tex}
  \caption{Tensor-product built from 16- and 25-point Gauss-Hermite rules.}
  \label{fig:tpexample}
\end{figure}

The implementation resides in \path{waveblocks/tensor_product_qr.hpp}.


\subsection{Genz-Keister Quadrature}
\label{subsec:gkquad}

If one wants to investigate higher dimensions, the tensor rule quickly becomes
unfeasible to compute in its full form.
As the results in section~\ref{sec:results} show, the run-times grow faster than
exponentially with increasing dimensionality, single quadratures taking minutes
already in the fourth dimension.

For this reason, specialized multi-dimensional schemes, such as the Genz-Keister
quadrature implemented here, operate on a reduced set of nodes.
The details of the procedure are outlined in \cite{B15_601}.
Similarly to the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, many of the intermediary
constants were tabulated beforehand.

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \input{figures/comparison-multi-dim.tex}
  \caption{Run-times for multi-dimensional homogeneous quadrature with 3
    coefficients per dimension.}
  \label{fig:comparisonmultid}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonmultid} shows the efficiency gain that can be achieved
by using this rule over the plain Gauss-Hermite tensor product quadrature.
For high dimensions, the difference in the run-times is over an order of
magnitude.
Choosing a lower level means less computational complexity at the cost of
numerical accuracy, so it has to be chosen suitably for the task.

More timings are shown in the final section in
figure~\ref{fig:speedupgenzkeister}.


\subsection{Implementation Details}

The three implemented quadrature rules share a similar structure in terms of
their function interface, but because the code makes heavy use of template
programming, no explicit inheritance hierarchy has been defined.

They provide the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{number\_nodes} for querying the number of nodes (non-trivial for
    tensor-products and Genz-Keister)
  \item \texttt{nodes} returning the the quadrature node positions,
  \item \texttt{weights} giving the quadrature node weights,
  \item \texttt{nodes\_and\_weights} as a utility method giving both of the
    above at once as a \texttt{std::pair}, and
  \item \texttt{clear\_cache}, described in section
    (\ref{subsec:resultcaching}).
\end{itemize}

Every method of the quadrature rule classes has been made static, so they need
not be instantiated.
Instead of quadrature rule objects holding a state at run-time, we utilize the
type-system and give all the necessary parameters as template arguments.
These are the Gauss-Hermite order, tensor-product base rules, and Genz-Keister
dimension and level.

This avoids the overhead of constructing objects at run-time just to pass on
parameters and makes some compile-time calculations possible.
On the other hand, these parameters must be hardcoded, making it impossible to
dynamically change the quadrature order, for instance.

Designing \texttt{TensorProductQR} to work this way proved to be challenging,
since it needs to receive an arbitrary number of other quadrature rule classes,
one for each dimension, as template parameters and call their methods.
This was accomplished using template parameter
packs\footnote{\url{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack}},
introduced in C++11.


\subsection{Result Caching}
\label{subsec:resultcaching}

As the node positions and weight values are tabulated with an external script
for Gauss-Hermite quadrature (\ref{subsec:ghquad}), the code for looking up and
returning those numbers is simple and fast.

However, in the case of tensor-product (\ref{subsec:tpquad}) and Genz-Keister
(\ref{subsec:gkquad}) quadrature, some calculations must be performed to yield
these values.
We wish to avoid re-calculating node and weight vectors when the same quadrature
rule is used many times, as is done in the case of wavepacket propagation over
many timesteps.

For this reason, the results are only calculated once for a given complex
rule, stored and re-used automatically on subsequent queries.
Since the quadrature rule classes are not instantiated, the caching is done in
\texttt{static} fields.

This has the advantage that the rule only has to be calculated once in the
entire run of the program as long as the quadrature rule is the same, even if it
is invoked in different scopes, without having to pass down an object explicitly
that holds a state.
On the other hand, no clean-up can be done automatically, so the method
\texttt{clear\_cache} must be called manually to free the memory used by the
cache.
